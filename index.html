                <h4>Almost every Indian you meet will admit to having an intense love affair with cricket. Emotions run high during every match. A win will see people spilling out on the streets and celebrating with the entire neighbourhood. A loss, however, breaks millions of Indian hearts. Cricket has often been likened to a religion in the country and these are the legends who have made the game what it is today.</h4>
